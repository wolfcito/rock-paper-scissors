It's a Legacy Game refactor with Hexagonal Architecture and TDD

## Description:
This project aims to rejuvenate an inherited game through a refactoring process that combines the powerful hexagonal architecture and Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. Our focus is on dividing the system into well-defined, isolated layers, allowing for greater flexibility and maintainability as we modernize the game.

## Key Features:

- Hexagonal Architecture: We implement a hexagonal architecture to clearly separate business concerns, user interfaces, and external services. This promotes a more modular structure and facilitates the integration of new functionalities.

- TDD (Test-Driven Development): Every change and enhancement to the game is addressed following TDD principles. We develop tests before writing production code, ensuring that new features do not introduce errors and maintaining the game's stability.

- Gradual Refactoring: Instead of rewriting the entire game at once, we opt for a gradual refactoring approach. This allows us to improve the existing code step by step, maintaining a functional game at all times.

- Documentation and Comments: As we progress with the refactoring, we document the process and add meaningful comments to the code to enhance understanding and collaboration among other developers.

- Quality Control: We utilize static code analysis tools and automated testing to uphold a high standard of code quality and ensure smooth game operation.

If you are a software development enthusiast, passionate about refactoring, and eager to contribute to the enhancement of a classic game using cutting-edge practices, join our project and help breathe new life into this industry gem! Your expertise and commitment are welcome on this exciting transformation journey.
